- Enabled "think" mode and reasoning support in LLM backends (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic).
- And a few smaller features build into the chat.

### LLM analysis
- Added `analyze_session` — passive LLM analysis pass that reads existing workflow session run logs, interprets them, and persists structured findings.
- Added `llm_agent_scan_result` tool — retrieve results of completed LLM agent scan sessions.
- Added `PhantomStrikeDB` (SQLite) for persisting LLM analysis sessions and vulnerability findings.
- Added `LLMClient` — provider-agnostic LLM adapter supporting Ollama, OpenAI, and Anthropic backends.

- Improved tool injection logic with confidence threshold and conversational pattern filtering.

### Session management
- Added follow-up session functionality — chain sessions for iterative engagements.
- Added session notes management, report generation, findings, and timeline view.
- Added AI analysis section surfacing vulnerabilities and risk level in session cards.

### Plugin system
- Introduced a drop-in plugin architecture — extend PhantomStrike without touching core code.
- Drop a folder under `plugins/tools/`, add an entry to `plugins.yaml`, and restart; the server auto-loads the plugin.
- Each tool plugin provides a Flask Blueprint (API endpoint) and a FastMCP registration (AI-callable tool).
- Failed plugins are skipped with a warning — server always starts cleanly.
- Bundled `example_net_ping` plugin as a copy-paste starting point.

### New tools
- Added `schemathesis` integration — property-based API fuzzing against OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas.
- Added `interactsh` wrapper — OOB interaction URL generation for blind SSRF/XSS detection.
- Added `http_headers` tool — fetches and displays HTTP response headers for a target URL.
- Added `dig` tool — DNS lookup via `dig` with configurable record type and nameserver.
- Added Burp Agent Loop API for autonomous pentesting integration.

### Performance and internals
- Implemented thread-safe lazy singleton pattern for service objects.
- Optimized SSE endpoints with unified stream for processes and pool stats, reducing duplicate events.
- Added CPU niceness adjustment and performance dashboard recording to command execution.
- Configurable session wait time for Metasploit execution.
- Improved tool registry validation and cache key hashing.
- Added session-wide subprocess mocking safety net for tests.

### Others
- Added `phantomstrike.sh` main entrypoint script with external tool install list.
