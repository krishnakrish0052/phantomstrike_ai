"""
server_core/intelligence/chat_personalities.py

Defines the built-in chat personality presets available in the Chat Widget.

Each preset provides a system prompt that shapes the AI assistant's tone and
behaviour. The active preset is selected via CHAT_PERSONALITY in config and
persisted to config_local.json.

The special id "custom" is not listed here — it is a UI-only sentinel that
tells the settings page to show the free-text textarea and use CHAT_CUSTOM_PROMPT
as the resolved system prompt.
